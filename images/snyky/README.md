Simple GOTTY container that allows remote access to a pod/cluster.
Setup with my favorite bash configs to make things easier. 

See the Dockerfile for more information. 

## NOTE
Take a look at the Dockerfile and make sure all the
requirements are met. You may want to update some 
of the static versions to a newer one. The binary
conmachi for example was built on 2/2/2020 and it
may need to be updated.
